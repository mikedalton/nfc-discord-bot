This allows extra clearance since the DC-ATX unit is thinner, but it presents two extra challenges. First, custom power cabling will be likely since the main power input needs to run farther to reach the AC-DC unit, and the 24-pin and 8-pin power need to run further to reach the motherboard. Second, the original version (not marked with a version number) of the AC-DC unit is too thick to fit flush along the front of the chassis. It either needs to have a section milled out to fit, or you need to use a version 2.0 AC-DC unit (made thinner to fit)."

The 400W DC-ATX unit has gone through several revisions, and the revision is printed directly on the unit. The pinout of the PCIe power connector was changed between versions 1.X, 2.0, and 2.1.

If you feel that you must mount it, then as per Josh, \"Use mounting tape. Grey/clear/or whatever from Scotch/3M if you NEED to, because it will come off without leaving sticky residue behind. And it's REALLY strong, way stronger than velcro. Velcro can hold really well, but it still vibrates in the hooks. Mounting tape doesn't.\" See: https://imgur.com/a/BqD27j2"
